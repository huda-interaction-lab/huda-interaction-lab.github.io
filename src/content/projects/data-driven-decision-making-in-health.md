In this work, we propose a system for analyzing Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits and thereby supporting the diagnosis and treatment of patients in ICU settings. The goal of the system is to infer recommendations for actions that medical staff should perform on a given patient. To achieve this, we find patients in similar conditions, and devise a number of strategies for recommending actions that should improve a patient’s medical state. These recommendations are derived from the set of similar patients and a patient’s most recent test results.
