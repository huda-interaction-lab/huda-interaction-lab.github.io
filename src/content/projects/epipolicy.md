EpiPolicy is a population-based epidemic simulator and policy aid that allows users to customize its compartmental model to capture different epidemic scenarios for epidemics like COVID-19. Its user interface makes it easy to define various interventions such as social distancing, school closure, vaccination, and disease-specific interventions. EpiPolicy aids policy makers by simulating and constructing locale-specific intervention schedules that reduce disease burden, and minimize social and economic costs
